# weather-view

A simple weather application built using my [ts-open-weather-map]() library with data provided by the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/).

The live version is available at: https://weather.davidfishlock.com

## Setup

To run the application locally, clone the repository and run:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

The application should now be viewable at http://localhost:3000 in the browser.

## Technologies

This application is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), with styling implemented using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Weather radar mapping is implemented using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), and graph visualizations are built using the [react-vis](https://uber.github.io/react-vis/) library.
